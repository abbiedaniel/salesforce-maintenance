- **Model View Controller Architecture:**
  - Model: where data is saved
      - Custom and standard objects and fields
  - View: how data is visualized
      - UI, page layout, Visualforce pages, apps, tabs, LWC, css, images
  - Controller: how data is manipulated/logic
      - Custom Apex and Javascript, flows, processes, workflow rules, email alerts

### Data Modeling & Management
- **Relationships**
  - Master-detail
    - Creates a special type of parent-child relationship between this object **(the child, or "detail")** and another object (the parent, or "master") where:
      - The relationship field is required on all detail records.
      - The ownership and sharing of a detail record are determined by the master record.
      - When a user deletes the master record, all detail records are deleted.
      - You can create **rollup summary fields on the master record** to summarize the detail records.
    - The relationship field allows users to click on a lookup icon **on the child** to select a value from a popup list. The master object is the source of the values in the list.
  - Lookup
    - Creates a relationship that links this object to another object.
    - The relationship field allows users to click on a lookup icon **on the child** to select a value from a popup list. The other object is the source of the values in the list.  
  - Junction
